[Introduction.](intro.html) A vignette.

[MASH v FLASH simulation results.](MASHvFLASHsims.html) Compares MASH and FLASH fits to data simulated from MASH and FLASH models.

[MASH v FLASH on GTEx (strong tests).](MASHvFLASHgtex.html) Compares MASH and FLASH fits to data from the GTEx project. FLASH does better imputing missing data.

[MASH v FLASH detailed simulation study.](MASHvFLASHsims2.html) Compares the performance of MASH and FLASH in a single simulation setting. MASH and FLASH perform differently on different covariance structures.

[MASH v FLASH detailed GTEx study.](MASHvFLASHgtex2.html) Uses an improved workflow to examine differences in MASH and FLASH fits to GTEx data. Particularly strong effects in a single condition might cause MASH to miss smaller effects that are shared among conditions. But FLASH might miss very small effects that are shared across all conditions.
