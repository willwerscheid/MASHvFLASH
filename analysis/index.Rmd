[Introduction.](intro.html) An introductory vignette.

[MASH v FLASH simulation results.](MASHvFLASHsims.html) Compares MASH and FLASH fits to data simulated from MASH and FLASH models.

[MASH v FLASH detailed simulation study.](MASHvFLASHsims2.html) Compares the performance of MASH and FLASH on different covariance structures in a single simulation setting.

[MASH v FLASH on GTEx (strong tests).](MASHvFLASHgtex.html) Compares MASH and FLASH fits to "strong" tests from the GTEx dataset.

[MASH v FLASH on GTEx (random tests).](MASHvFLASHrandom.html) Same, but uses random tests from the GTEx dataset.

[MASH v FLASH workflows for GTEx.](MASHvFLASHgtex2.html) Proposes improved workflows to obtain MASH and FLASH fits to GTEx data.

[MASH v FLASH detailed analysis: MASH v OHF.](MASHvOHF.html) The first of several analyses that identify specific differences between fits.
