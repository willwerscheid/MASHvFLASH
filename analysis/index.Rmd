[Introduction.](intro.html) A vignette.

[MASH v FLASH simulation results.](MASHvFLASHsims.html) Compares MASH and FLASH fits to data simulated from both MASH and FLASH models.

[MASH v FLASH on GTEx.](MASHvFLASHgtex.html) Compares MASH and FLASH fits to data from the GTEx project. FLASH does better imputing missing data.

[MASH v FLASH detailed simulation study.](MASHvFLASHsims2.html) Using the "OHL" method, compares the performance of FLASH-pn, FLASH-ash, and MASH in a single simulation setting. FLASH and MASH perform differently on different covariance structures. There is little or no advantage to using ash priors rather than point-normals.

[MASH v FLASH detailed GTEx study.](MASHvFLASHgtex2.html) Uses an improved workflow to examine differences in MASH and FLASH fits to GTEx data. Particularly strong effects in a single condition might cause MASH to miss smaller effects that are shared among conditions. But FLASH might miss very small effects that are shared across all conditions.
