# Output

Files `sim#res.rds`, `sim#time.png`, and `sim#ROC.png` were created for analysis MASHvFLASHsims using the code in `main.R`.

Files whose names begin with `gtex`, `sims2`, and `gtex2` were created for analyses MASHvFLASHgtex, MASHvFLASHsims2, and MASHvFLASHgtex2 using the code in, respectively, `gtex.R`, `sims2.R`, and `gtex2.R`. 

`gtexrandomfit.Rds` and `gtexstrongfit.Rds` are exceptions to these naming conventions: they were created by `gtex2.R`, not `gtex.R`.
